	/** This allows you to change the way the left and right keys move the cursor when there are items of different height, like fractions.
	 * 
	 * By default, the Left and Right keys move the cursor through all possible cursor positions in a particular order: right into a fraction puts the cursor at the left end of the numerator, right out of the numerator puts the cursor at the left end of the denominator, and right out of the denominator puts the cursor to the right of the fraction. Symmetrically, left into a fraction puts the cursor at the right end of the denominator, etc.
	 * 
	 * If instead you want right to always visually go right, and left to always go visually left, you can set `leftRightIntoCmdGoes` to `'up'` or `'down'` so that left and right go up or down (respectively) into commands. For example, `'up'` means that left into a fraction goes up into the numerator and right out of the numerator skips the denominator and puts the cursor to the right of the fraction. This behavior can be seen in the Desmos calculator. If this property is set to `'down'` instead, the numerator is harder to navigate to, like in the Mac OS X built-in app Grapher. */

	/** `charsThatBreakOutOfSupSub` takes a string of the chars that when typed, "break out" of superscripts and subscripts.
	 * 
	 * Normally, to get out of a superscript or subscript, a user has to navigate out of it with the directional keys, a mouse click, tab, or Space if `spaceBehavesLikeTab` is true. For example, typing `x^2n+y` normally results in the LaTeX `x^{2n+y}`. If you wanted to get the LaTeX `x^{2n}+y`, the user would have to manually move the cursor out of the exponent.
	 * 
	 * If this option was set to `'+-'`, `+` and `-` would "break out" of the exponent. This doesn't apply to the first character in a superscript or subscript, so typing `x^-6` still results in `x^{-6}`. The downside to setting this option is that in order to type `x^{n+m}`, a workaround like typing `x^(n+m` and then deleting the `(` is required. */

You can also specify a speech-friendly representation of the operator name by supplying the operator name, a `|` and its speech alternative (separate multiple words with a `-`). For example, `'sin|sine cos|cosine tan|tangent sinh|hyperbolic-sine'`. */

	 * 
	 * For example, [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) substitutes `<span tabindex=0></span>` on iOS to suppress the built-in virtual keyboard in favor of a custom math keypad that calls the MathQuill API. Unfortunately there's no universal [check for a virtual keyboard](http://stackoverflow.com/q/2593139/362030) or [way to detect a touchscreen](http://www.stucox.com/blog/you-cant-detect-a-touchscreen/), and even if you could, a touchscreen â‰  virtual keyboard (Windows 8 and ChromeOS devices have both physical keyboards and touchscreens and iOS and Android devices can have Bluetooth keyboards). Desmos currently sniffs the user agent for iOS, so Bluetooth keyboards just don't work in Desmos on iOS. The tradeoffs are up to you. */
